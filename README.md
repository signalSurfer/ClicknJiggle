Clicknjiggle uses pyautogui to move the mouse within a defined area and click. 
the script will pause clicking and jiggling for 1 minute when the mouse is pulled out of bounds, allowing you to control without interruption

todo:
poll mouse position - restart jiggling when mouse is in the same position for 1min +, otherwise add a minute to timeout
frantic clicks - add a few clicks in succession to emulate checking on a page
movement arch - calculate archs and add random arching to mimic more humanlike mouse movement
